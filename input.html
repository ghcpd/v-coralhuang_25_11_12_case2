      "input": "User enters 'example' or 'https//missing-colon.com' and presses Submit.",
      "actual_behavior": "All iframe loaders remain visible indefinitely. The input box is locked. No error message appears. Console shows DNS or cross-origin errors.",
      "expected_behavior": "The system should validate the URL format before loading. Invalid input should trigger an inline error message and prevent the loading state."
    },

      "id": "UI-002",
      "title": "Asynchronous iframe loaders never synchronize",
      "input": "User loads a valid URL where one iframe completes loading early while others are still pending.",
      "actual_behavior": "Some frames display content, others remain stuck with a loading spinner. The global loading indicator never clears.",
      "expected_behavior": "Each iframe should manage its own loader independently, and the global indicator should disappear once all frames are either completed or failed."

      "id": "UI-003",
      "title": "Cross-domain access triggers blocking alert and UI freeze",
      "input": "User enters an external site (e.g., 'https://google.com') and presses Submit.",
      "actual_behavior": "A blocking alert() appears with a browser security message. All iframes reset to the default page after user dismisses the alert. The loader remains active.",
      "expected_behavior": "The system should handle cross-origin restrictions gracefully using non-blocking UI feedback (toast or inline banner) and replace the affected iframe with a placeholder message."

      "id": "UI-004",
      "title": "Concurrent submissions break loader synchronization",
      "input": "User quickly submits multiple URLs before the first load completes.",
      "actual_behavior": "Previous loaders are not cleared. Some iframes display old content while others refresh with the new URL. The interface flickers between states.",
      "expected_behavior": "The application should cancel previous loading tasks, reset all loaders, and only render the most recent requested URL consistently."

      "title": "Incorrect scrollbar toggle logic distorts layout",
      "input": "User repeatedly checks and unchecks the 'Show scrollbar' checkbox.",
      "actual_behavior": "Iframe widths continuously increase or shrink due to cumulative width adjustments. Layout becomes misaligned and horizontal scrolling breaks.",
      "expected_behavior": "The scrollbar toggle should apply a fixed CSS class without altering inline width values. Layout widths should remain stable."

      "input": "One iframe fails to load while others succeed.",
      "actual_behavior": "Some loader icons remain visible even after successful iframes finish. The failed iframe does not show any error placeholder.",
      "expected_behavior": "Each loader should hide once the corresponding iframe completes or fails, and failed iframes should display a clear fallback message."

      "title": "Frame container width calculation not reactive to resize",
